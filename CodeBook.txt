Overview
========

This code book describes the data provided as part of the final submission for the Getting and Cleaning data course on Coursera. 


STUDY DESIGN
============

The study design is described in the README.txt file for the raw data present in 
	 - UCI HAR Dataset/README.txt
	 
The description of the raw data used is also present in the .txt files available in
	- UCI HAR Dataset/


DATASET DESCRIPTION
===================

The dataset includes the following files /folders:

	- CodeBook.txt	
		
	- UCI HAR Dataset/	# The folder with raw data used for this analysis after unzipping
	
	- InstructionList.txt	
	
	- UCI HAR Dataset.zip	# The raw data as downloaded
	
	- README.txt		
	
	- run_analysis.R	
	
	- Intermediate files generated by script for use in final data creation	
		+ tempData/activity_master.csv	# tidy activity master
		+ tempData/test_tidy_data.csv	# tidy test data set
		+ tempData/train_tidy_data.csv	# tidy training data set
	
	- Final tidy output files required by assignment. The sets are all identified by subject_id and activity_name. The column names in these files have been derived from the raw data file "UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt" after passing the list of names through make.names() to make them unique. The data in these data sets except for the identifying columns all represent derivations of the inertial measurements and are expressed in the same units of standard gravity units "g" and radians/sec as the raw data.
		+ tidyoutput/merged_all_data_tidy.csv
		+ tidyoutput/mean_stddev_only_data_tidy.csv
		+ tidyoutput/average_mean_stddev_tidy_by_subject_activity.csv
		+ tidyoutput/average_mean_stddev_tidy_by_subject_activity.txt
	
	- UCI HAR Dataset/features_info.txt
		+ describes the features in the "merged_all_data_tidy.csv" set and its subset "mean_stddev_only_data_tidy.csv"
	
	- UCI HAR Dataset/README.txt
		+ Describes more information about the derivation of the data in the "merged_all_data_tidy.csv" set and its subset "mean_stddev_only_data_tidy.csv"
	
	- FILE / DATA SET: mean_stddev_only_data_tidy.csv
		+ This file represents a subset of the all the tidy data that captures only the measures that represent the mean and standard deviation of the initial measures. 
	
	- FILE / DATA SET: average_mean_stddev_tidy_by_subject_activity.csv / average_mean_stddev_tidy_by_subject_activity.txt
		+ This file represents the average of each  measure that represents the mean and standard deviation of the initial measures  for each subject and activity combination. The column names for this set represent this with the addition of "average_of" to the names of the measures that were averaged. 
		+ The ".txt" file was added to satisfy the needs of the submission that called for output using write.table rather than write.csv! - At the time of the submission!
